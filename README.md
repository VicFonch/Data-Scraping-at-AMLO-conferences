# Data-Scraping-at-AMLO-conferences

In this code I perform a web scraping to the AMLO presidential website, from which I extract all the public conferences until January 2023.

This database is available in my Kaggle profile at the link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vfontefontechavez/amlo-conferences-from-2018-to-2023
